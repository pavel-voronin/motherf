; Ok, just add 65 to current memory cell and output, right?

QLXV.Q ; we cannot use "A" for macro name, let it be "Q"

; Initially memory cell is 0

Q ; "A"

; The problem is the cell now is 65!
; So the next call will increment the cell by 65 again

; We definitely have to get rid of side effect

; We cannot redefine macros so let's create new one

W LXV . | LXV | W ; inc 65, output, reverse inc (dec) 65, reverse order again 

>++W ; "C", memory cell contains 2, not 67

; Now it's correct replacement for A-command

A ; "C" again, memory is untouched
