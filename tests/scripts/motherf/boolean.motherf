; Limiting cell size

; =-command limits current cell max value by current value
; ~-command cancels limit of current cell max value
; 0-command outputs memory[pointer] + 44

+   ; cell = 1
=   ; now max value equals 1
0   ; "1"
+0  ; "0" as max value is 1
--0 ; still "0"

; Now this cell has type Boolean as it can be 0 and 1 only

~-  ; cell = 255, limits off
